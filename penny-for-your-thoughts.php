<h2>Judge Penny Gives "Real" Advice </h2>
<img src="images/advice.jpg"/ style="margin-left:25px;">
<p align="left"> <h3>Cyber Emotional Relationships:  Real or Harmless </h3><br />
  <p>
  I recently had a friend to seek my advice about whether or not she  was involved in an emotional affair online and if indeed I felt she had crossed  the line. She had reconnected with a friend from high school on Facebook.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t particularly remember him from  school, but over time they had begun daily communications online. <br />
  <br />
  She insisted that she was not in physical contact with the person,  but that she could feel in her heart that something different was happening to  her.&nbsp; In my opinion, she only asked the  question because she wanted to be able to talk about their conversations with  me. After listening to her situation, it became clear to me that she was having  an emotional affair, albeit on line.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  Although she sought my advice, it was clear that she wasn&rsquo;t really  looking for me to tell her the truth.&nbsp;  Her initial response was that but because there was no physical contact,  how in the world could she be having an affair. &nbsp;&nbsp;I explained that I felt she was having an &ldquo;emotional  affair&rdquo; which, in actuality, could be equally as damaging to her current relationship  with her spouse.<br />
  After raising this issue during a recent staff meeting, I realized  that there is considerable debate and confusion about what constitutes  emotional affairs, particularly those online. &nbsp;Because these online emotional affairs usually  start out innocently enough as a friendship, there may be a feeling that they  are somehow not real.&nbsp; However, they are  very real.<br />
  <br />
  The obvious question is what is an emotional online affair? An  emotional affair occurs when online or internet communication allows people to  develop a level of intimacy that distracts from another relationship.&nbsp; Relationships are about intimacy, trust, and  openness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is because these  communications are online, people may feel that it blurs the definition of  cheating.&nbsp; When cheating, in most cases,  isn&rsquo;t about the physical, but about an emotional and psychological connection  with someone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone wants to be  heard and everyone wants to matter.&nbsp;  These online relationships often allow people to share their deepest  feelings. <br />
  I recognized that my friend was involved in an emotional affair  because she was sharing intimate thoughts and feelings with this other person.&nbsp; Once it moved from casual social contact  online to a situation where this person became an increasing focus of her time,  I knew there was a problem.&nbsp; It moved  from a casual acquaintance &ldquo;friend&rdquo; online to a true relationship.<br />
  <br />
  The key for me was the fact that the relationship had become a  &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to her partner. &nbsp;This is the  number one sign that an emotional affair has evolved. &nbsp;Secrets have no place in real relationships. &nbsp;She started telling her online friend about  her problems, her joys, their common interests and her dreams.&nbsp; All the time she spent online communicating  allowed her to develop an emotional bond with this person.<br />
  The online friendship grew into a strong bond that was wrapped in  secrecy.&nbsp; The time she should have spent  with her partner at home was being taken up by the time and energy she was  putting into this online relationship.&nbsp;  It was clear to me that &nbsp;she was  having an emotional affair.<br />
  <br />
  You know that you have crossed the line when the online friend and  you have developed an intimacy of your own. Other signs include investing a  great deal of time and intimate communication of your thoughts and feelings.&nbsp; Your emotional energy toward your partner is  limited because you are now sharing your deepest&nbsp; feelings with the online friend.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  You may feel guilt free because there is no physical contact, but  you know in your heart that you have become attached to this other person.&nbsp; If the relationship is a secret from your  partner, you spend a large amount of time on the computer with this online  person and you have not included your partner in the discussion --- you have  crossed the line.<br />
  <br />
  Emotional affairs are about betrayal and are devastating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once these emotional affairs become  personal, they can open the door to negative repercussions occurring in your  life. &nbsp;It is easy to sit at computer and  pour your heart out while the online person seems to understand and connect  with you in a powerful way.&nbsp;  <br />
  <br />
  Relationships, however, are open and take a great deal of energy and work.&nbsp; Nothing good can come from anything that  takes way from your partner&rsquo;s emotional bond. These emotional online affairs  are unacceptable.&nbsp; <br />
  If my friend had to ask the question, deep down inside, she  already knew the answer.</p>
