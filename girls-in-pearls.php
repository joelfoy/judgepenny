		<p>Judge Pennyâ€™s Girls in P.E.A.R.L.S. Mentoring Academy is for girls twelve to eighteen years. It is a spiritually based academic initiative whereby the Foundation   hosts monthly theme activities in which the girls are introduced to various life lessons with the goal of fulfilling the tenants of sacred womanhood.  They are personally mentored, loved, inspired, disciplined and held to both responsibility and accountability in their church, their homes and their community.</p>
		<p>The Girls learning experiences are tailored specifically to their development to womanhood against a clear set of academic standards receiving personal engagement with mentors.</p> 
		<p>The Mentoring Academy maintains a high standard of excellence.  They are taught leadership principles, exposed to educational, cultural and social events, while at the same time forming a commitment to sisterhood and attending college.</p>  
		<p>Very special girls with promise, purpose, potential and persistence are invited to membership.</p>
		<p>The fundamental lesson the girls are taught is that God is inspirable from success.</p>
