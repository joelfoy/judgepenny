<p><img src="images/story.jpg"/ style="float:left; margin:0px 6px 6px 0px;"><em style=" color:#4025D9;">Excerpt from the Introduction to Judge Penny’s Book, 7 Steps to Peace of Mind.</em></p>


<p>I want to tell you a personal story so that you can understand how situations outside of ourselves can help shape how we view ourselves and what we can expect from life. I was born to a single mother. I grew up not knowing myfather. At some point, I was told about my father, but theman never showed love or interest in me. I believe it was because he felt that I was not his child. </p>

<p>Growing up in a majority Catholic small town inLaplace, Louisiana was not easy for someone who livedwith her single mother and grandparents in the same house.
While attending a brand new Catholic school, all of the girlsin my third grade class were invited to a classmate’s birthdaytea party. In my opinion, she was a little girl who had everything. She lived in a big brick house and she had parentswho were both educators. She was so very pretty. </p>

<p>Evenas a child, I was never envious of her or anyone else. I just wondered what it would be like to have the life she had. Idid believe, however, that somehow she was better than meand my family because of her house and parents. Needless to say, I was so happy to be able to attend thistea party. </p>

<p>My mother took me to New Orleans on the busand we shopped on Canal Street. She bought me a new pinkdress with a jacket and pleats on the bottom. I had a whitestraw hat, white patent leather shoes and purse and whitegloves. I remember it as if it was yesterday because I havealways liked fashion.We bought the birthday girl a wonderful present and mymother wrapped it nicely. I barely slept for days because Iwas so excited. The day of the party finally arrived. I got alldressed up and I can remember my grandmother and my mother standing on the front porch of our old shotgunhouse, in a place we called, “down the road,” waving as mygrandfather and I pulled off and headed over the railroad tracks to the party.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday afternoon and my grandfather droppedme off in his pickup truck at the front door. I jumped out ofthe truck because I saw a few of my other friends headed to the front door at just about the same time. My grandfathertold me to call him when I was ready to be picked upbecause we lived in the neighboring town. All of my classmates were at the door. Everyone was dressed so pretty, butI felt that I looked the best because my mother had suchgreat taste. I finally felt like I was one of them. I finally feltlike I belonged. It was the happiest day of my life.</p>

<p>The girl’s mother answered the door and allowed all ofus into their beautiful foyer. Everyone saw the birthday girland ran toward her. But her mother grabbed me by the arm,pulled me aside and said in the harshest tone I had everheard, “What are you doing here?” My insides began totremble. I instantly knew in my spirit that it was too good tobe true, but I was sure I could explain.I opened my white purse and pulled out the invitationand showed it to her. I remember looking up at her with asmile on my face, while she glared at me with contempt.</p>

<p>She said the invitation was a mistake because she was notgoing to have a bastard child at her daughter’s party. Shethen opened the door and closed it, leaving me and her daughter’s present on the outside. I was shocked. I beganwalking away when I remembered the present. I turnedaround and leaned it up against the front door. I could hearlaughter on the other side of the door. This was the first doorthat had been closed on my life. I turned around and startedto walk. All I can remember is walking. We lived a long distance,but I kept walking and walking and walking. Isomehow knew I would never be the same. I cried all theway home. I made a decision during that long walk thatwould impact my life and how I viewed things for years tocome.</p>

<p>I arrived home hours later and opened the screen door ofthe house. While growing up, I never remembered the frontdoor being locked during the daytime. I opened the door, walked past the living room, through the bedroom and intothe kitchen. Granny was at the kitchen table. She said that shethought I was supposed to call. I lied and said that I had beendropped off by one of my friend’s parents. My motherwalked into the kitchen from the back porch. </p>

<p>I told them allthe wonderful details about a party I was not good enough toattend. Granny and my mother both died never knowing whatreally happened on the day that changed my life forever.You must understand one important thing about thestory. Had I told my mother what that awful woman haddone to me, she would have given that woman a piece of hermind. </p>

<p>I desperately wanted peace, not only for me but foreveryone else around me. I lied that day to protect mymother and make it all go away. I did not want to believethat I was not good enough. I did not want to accept whatthe woman had said to me. Therefore, I pretended that allwas well. Somehow it made things better at the time, buthow could I know that it would haunt me for most of mylife. </p>

<p>That Sunday afternoon changed my life forever. Mypeace of mind was taken away from me at the age of seven or eight years old.I spent most of my adult life feeling as if I neverbelonged at the party or anywhere else. While growing up,I used my education and extracurricular activities to provethat what I was feeling was wrong. The message stayed inmy spirit for many years. I frequently made decisions aboutmy life with the motivation to prove to the world that Ibelonged and I was good enough. I wanted to prove that Iwas good enough to attend that party and any other party Iwanted to attend.If we all took a moment to reflect, I am certain that youcan pinpoint the time when your peace was stolen from you.</p>

<p>Many years later, I actually thank God for giving me themindset that allowed me to fight to prove the world wrong.The experience was one in which no little girl should havehad to go through, but it gave me a drive in life that I maynot have had but for that experience.</p>
<p>I later learned that my friend’s life was not quite the storybookthat I had imagined. Sure, the family lived in a bighouse and the parents were married and educated, but the littlegirl’s mother was an alcoholic. Learning the truthabout her life, however, did not help me find peace of mind.</p>

<p>I had to learn that it wasn’t where I came from or what others thought of me that mattered.  What is important is what I’ve managed to do with my life. Let my story serve as an example that it doesn’t matter how you start off in life, but rather what you do with it.  The legacy I wish to leave is a legacy of empowerment and purpose.  Don’t allow anyone to tell you that you don’t matter because you are different or because you may not be like everyone else. </p>
