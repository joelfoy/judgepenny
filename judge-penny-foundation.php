	<h2>What We Believe!</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<h3>Welcome to the Foundation</h3>
		<p>As a child, I rose from the shadows of poverty with a unique perspective for the delivery of both justice and ministry. As a result of my experiences, I have developed a framework for my life that is dedicated to the fundamental principles of justice, equality, civic engagement and service.  This foundation represents my vision to change the lives of people. As human beings, we are strongest when we work together to help those who are most vulnerable. I embrace the concept of “loving thy neighbor.” Neighbor love is the missing piece in our society today.  There are a number of people who specialize in criticizing the problems in our communities instead of doing something about them.  They expect everyone else to be a savior. We all have a role to play in making the world a better place.</p>
		<p>We must teach the next generation to stop making excuses and come together and create a change in our communities.  Change can come one person at a time. It takes commitment, love, passion, and a desire to give of your time in order to solve the problems of today.</p>
		<p>The Judge Penny Brown Reynolds Foundation, Inc. is committed to the principle that all people are created equal and that our social, economic, religious, and political structures should support self-sufficiency and dignity of all individuals and families.  We have the ability to make a difference.  The question is – do we care enough to do so.</p>
